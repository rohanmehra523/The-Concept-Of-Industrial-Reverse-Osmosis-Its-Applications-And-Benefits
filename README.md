# The-Concept-Of-Industrial-Reverse-Osmosis-Its-Applications-And-Benefits
For any manufacturing company, the ideal investment is the one that can increase their Return On Investment (ROI). Most of the capital of these manufacturing industries is being spent on water resources. Industrial Reverse Osmosis or Reverse Osmosis is a concept that can help these industries in increasing their return on investment with minimal expenses. <br>
The process of industrial reverse osmosis is a high-tech method used to purify or filter the water. Reverse Osmosis is a water treatment process for the production of fresh and low-salinity potable water via membrane separation. This technique can be used for domestic and industrial water purification purposes. It uses a tightly wound, semi-permeable membrane to remove the dissolved contaminants in the water. In the industrial reverse osmosis process, the water travels from the high mineral concentration side to the clean/ filtered side. The minerals and other contaminants dissolved in the water cannot pass through the membrane and so this results in mineral-free and clean water that is fit for reuse or consumption. <br>
The process of reverse osmosis includes the use of mechanical parts like the water pump and, ultrafine filtering (UF) membranes that facilitate reliable and affordable ways to filter water.  The systems also need to be maintained to them for optimal functioning. This requires the use of reverse osmosis membrane cleaning chemicals that help in cleaning the UF membrane. Modern RO systems are not just cost-effective, they are also powerful and thus quite reliable. Industrial reverse osmosis can be applied in several areas like: <br>
•	Wastewater Treatment <br>
Water treatment industries have taken reverse osmosis as one of the water purification methods. RO is employed as the final process to remove chemical, bacterial, and dissolved impurities in the processed water. Reverse osmosis systems are a part of the tertiary water treatment. Industrial wastewater is also pre-treated using a reverse osmosis system before safe disposal. <br>

•	Municipal Water Purification <br>
Municipal water is used for commercial and domestic applications and thus the water must be clean and of high quality. In addition to cooking and washing purposes, water is also used in the food and beverage industry, in pharmaceutical industries, and in chemical industries. Thus, commercial RO systems are utilized in purifying the water to ensure good quality water. <br>

•	Desalination of Seawater <br>
For many populated areas and areas with less groundwater, the only water comes from oceans or seas. This water has salt levels of up to 35,000 mg/l. in addition to this, marina industries, off-shore drilling, maritime transport, and cruise ships also rely on seawater. The continuous use of water containing high levels of salt content can lead to damage of the marine equipment and is also unfit for consumption. Thus, marine industries use high-pressure reverse osmosis systems with special membranes to remove the salt content from seawater. Along with desalination, the system also helps in the reduction of chemical and bacterial contamination. <br>

•	Desalination of Brackish Water <br>
Brackish water is combined fresh and saltwater that has around 1000 to 1500 mg/l of dissolved salts. The recommended salinity of water suggested by WHO for industrial and potable water applications is less than 500mg/l. Thus, desalination of brackish water is also done by reverse osmosis. <br>

•	Boiler Feed Water <br>
The use of hard water in industrial boilers can cause problems like scaling, thermal transfer deficiencies, increased downtime for cleaning, and reduced life cycle of the boiler vessel. Therefore, only softened water should be fed to the boiler system. Therefore, the mechanical, chemical, pharmaceutical, and pulp industries use RO systems to process the water before feeding it to the boiler system. <br>
Benefits of Industrial Reverse Osmosis for Manufacturing Facilities <br>
Water purification has proven to be quite complicated and costly for many companies. Reverse Osmosis systems can help these industries meet temporary, and long-term water treatment needs. There are various benefits of using Reverse Osmosis to treat water in industries: <br>
•	Environmental Benefits: One of the main benefits of using a Reverse Osmosis System is less hazardous wastewater. It is one of the greenest solutions for industrial wastewater. It prevents the discharge of harmful, chemically saturated water from going to effluent or the drain. <br>

•	Cost Benefits: The prices of reverse osmosis and membrane elements are low as compared to the prices for acid and caustic solutions. Modern water filtration systems also consume very little energy thus keeping operating costs to a minimal. <br>
	
•	Health and Safety Benefits: RO systems produce high-quality water without the use of hazardous chemicals. Traditionally, resin-based ion exchange systems use highly toxic acids and alkalis. <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/RO-Chemicals.php">RO chemicals manufacturers in India</a> provide non-toxic and efficient chemicals to use for water treatment. <br>

•	Maintenance Benefits: Reverse Osmosis Systems is maintenance-friendly as it is a self-contained unit. It requires minimal operator interaction and can also self-clean. The membrane can last for 2-3 years depending on factors like quality and quantity of feed water. <br>

With such advantages and benefits, the use of RO systems for water purification is set to increase. To reap the benefits of a reverse osmosis system for your industrial application, you must source the RO systems from a prominent provider in your country. <br>
